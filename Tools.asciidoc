== General Notes

* Arguments that take lists have their elements separated by commas. For example, `-i` _files_ means `-i file1,file2,...`.
Empty lists are not allowed. For example, there must be at least one file in the list `file1,file2,...`.

* You can run any tool with the `-h` option to get a help summary.
