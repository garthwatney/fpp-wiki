== General Notes

* Arguments that take lists have their elements separated by commas. For example, `-i` _files_ means `-i file1,file2,...`.
Empty lists are not allowed. For example, there must be at least one file in the list `file1,file2,...`.

* You can run any tool with the `-h` option to get a help summary.

* As of v1.0.0, FPP assumes that there are no shell or OS delimiter characters 
in the path names of FPP files.
In particular, you should replace spaces with dashes or underscores in (1) the 
names of any FPP files and
(2) the names of any directories that transitively contain FPP files.
Similarly for `'`, `"`, `,`, `/`, `:`, etc.
