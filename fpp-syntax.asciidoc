This tool parses FPP source files into an abstract syntax tree (AST) and optionally writes out the AST. It is mainly useful during compiler development.

*Flags:*

. `-a`: Print the AST.

. `-i`: Resolve include specifiers.

*Input:*  A list _fl_ of files: either the single file _stdin_ or a list of files specified on the command line.

*Output:*

. By default, no output if the parsing succeeds; otherwise an error message.

. If option `-a` is present, then a text representation of the AST.

*Procedure*:

. Parse each of the files in _fl_ to a translation unit _tu_, reporting any errors that occur.

. If `-i` is present, then recursively resolve include specifiers. Check for include cycles. Upon detecting an include cycle, halt with an error message.

. If `-a` is present, then write out the AST as text.
