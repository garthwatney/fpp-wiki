The *Analysis Data Structure* represents the results of FPP source analysis.
It contains the following members.

* *Component map:* A map from
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[component symbols]
to the corresponding
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[components].

* *Component instance map:* A map from
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[component instance symbols]
to the corresponding
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[component instances].

* *Dependency file set:* The set of 
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[files] 
on which the analysis depends.

* *Included file set:* The set of 
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[files] 
included when parsing input.

* *Input file set:* The set of 
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[files] 
presented to the analyzer.

* *Location specifier map:* A map from pairs (symbol kind, qualified name) to 
location specifiers.
Each entry in the map represents the specified location of a 
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[symbol].

* *Missing dependency file set:* The subset of the dependency file set 
consisting of files that could not be opened.

* *Nested scope:* A 
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[nested 
scope] object
that represents the current position in a scope traversal.

* *Parent symbol map:* A map from
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[symbols] 
to their parent symbols.
For example, the symbol for a constant definition appearing inside a module
_M_ is mapped to the symbol form _M_.

* *Scope name list:* A list of unqualified names representing the enclosing 
scopes, with the innermost name at the head of the list. For example, inside 
module `B` where `B` is inside `A` and `A` is at the top level, the scope name 
list is `[ B, A ]`.

* *Symbol-scope map:* A map from 
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[symbols] 
to their 
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[scopes].

* *Topology map:* A map from
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[topology symbols]
to the corresponding
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[topologies].

* *Type map:* A map from
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[type and 
constant symbols],
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[expressions],
and
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[type 
names]
to their
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[types].

* *Use-def map:* A map from uses 
(https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[expressions]
and
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[qualified 
identifiers]
that refer to definitions)
to the 
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[symbols] 
representing their definitions.

* *Use-def matching list:* The list of
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[use-def 
matchings]
on the current use-def path.
Used during
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Check-Use-Def-Cycles[cycle 
analysis].

* *Use-def symbol set:* The set of
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[symbols]
on the current use-def path.
Used during 
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Check-Use-Def-Cycles[cycle 
analysis].

* *Used symbol set:* The set of symbols used. Used during code generation.

* *Value map:* A map from
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[constant 
symbols]
and
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[expressions]
to their
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[values].

* *Visited symbol set:* The set of
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis#data-structures[symbols]
visited so far.

An empty analysis data structure has the following configuration:

. The sets, lists, and maps are empty.

. The nested scope contains a single empty scope representing the global scope.
