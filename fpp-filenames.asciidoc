This tool writes out the names of XML and C++ files generated
from FPP source files.

*Options:*

. `-a`: Enable automatic setup of unit tests.

. `-t`: Write the names of implementation template files.

. `-u`: Write the names of unit test files.

*Input:*  A list _fl_ of files: either the single file _stdin_ or a list of 
files specified on the command line.

*Output:* A list of file names, written one per line to standard output,
with no other punctuation.

. By default, the elements of the list are the names of the XML and C++ autocode files
that would be generated
by running `fpp-to-xml` and `fpp-to-cpp` on _fl_ and importing the dependencies
of _fl_.

. If one or more of the options `-a`, `-t`, or `-t` are present, then the listed C++ files
are the ones that would be generated
by running `fpp-to-cpp` with the corresponding options.

*Procedure*:

. Parse each of the files in _fl_, generating a list _tul_ of translation units.
When parsing, recursively resolve include specifiers.

. Walk the AST and identify the definitions that cause XML or C++ files to
be generated.

. Write out the names of the generated files.
