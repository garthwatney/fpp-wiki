This tool writes out the names of XML and C++ files generated
from FPP source files.

*Flags:*

. `-t`: Write the names of generated implementation template files.

*Input:*  A list _fl_ of files: either the single file _stdin_ or a list of 
files specified on the command line.

*Output:* A list of file names, written one per line to standard output,
with no other punctuation.

. By default, the elements of the list are the names of the XML and C++ autocode files
that would be generated
by running `fpp-to-xml` and `fpp-to-cpp` on _fl_ and importing the dependencies
of _fl_.

. If the option `-t` is present, then the elements of the list are the names of the
C++ implementation template files that would be generated by running `fpp-to-cpp`
on _fl_ and importing the dependencies of _fl_.

*Procedure*:

. Parse each of the files in _fl_, generating a list _tul_ of translation units.
When parsing, recursively resolve include specifiers.

. Walk the AST and identify the definitions that cause XML or C++ files to
be generated.

. Write out the names of the generated files.
