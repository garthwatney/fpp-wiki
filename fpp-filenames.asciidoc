This tool writes out the names of XML and C++ files generated
from FPP source files.

*Input:*  A list _fl_ of files: either the single file _stdin_ or a list of 
files specified on the command line.

*Output:* The names of the XML and C++ files that would be generated
by running `fpp-to-xml` and `fpp-to-cpp` on these files and importing
their dependencies.

*Procedure*:

. Parse each of the files in _fl_, generating a list _tul_ of translation units.
When parsing, recursively resolve include specifiers.

. Walk the AST and identify the definitions that cause XML or C++ files to
be generated.

. Write out the names of the generated files.
