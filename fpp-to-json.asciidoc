*Note: This tool is in development.*

This tool parses an FPP model, performs semantic checking on it, and writes out 
the model in Javascript Object Notation (JSON) format.

*Options:*

. TODO

*Input:*  

. A list _fl_ of files to translate: either the single file _stdin_ or a list of 
files specified on the command line.

*Output:* 

. TODO

*Procedure*:

. Parse each of the files in _fl_, generating a list _tul_ of translation units.
When parsing, recursively resolve include specifiers.

. Perform https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Checking-Semantics[semantic checking] on 
the concatenation of _tul_

. Convert the abstract syntax tree (AST), the map of AST nodes to source locations, and the 
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis-Data-Structure[Analysis data structure]
to JSON objects.

. Write the JSON objects to files.
