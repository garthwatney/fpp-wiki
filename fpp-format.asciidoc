This tool parses FPP source files into an abstract syntax tree (AST) and writes out the AST as formatted source code.

*Flags:*

. `-i`: Resolve include specifiers.

*Input:*  A list _fl_ of files: either the single file _stdin_ or a list of files specified on the command line.

*Output:* Formatted FPP source code, written to standard output.

*Procedure*:

. Parse each of the files in _fl_ to a translation unit _tu_, reporting any errors that occur.

. If `-i` is present, then recursively resolve include specifiers. Check for include cycles. Upon detecting an include cycle, halt with an error message.

. Write out the formatted source code.
