Welcome to the wiki for F Prime Prime (FPP). FPP is a domain-specific modeling language for the
https://github.com/nasa/fprime-sw[F Prime flight software framework].

To use FPP, you write a model in the source language;
then you use the FPP tools to generate XML and C++.
Compared to writing XML by hand, FPP provides a cleaner and more succinct syntax,
a well-defined semantics, good error checking and reporting, and better integration
between the model and the generated code.

== Our Motto

image::diagrams/fpp.png[]

This motto, derived from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, explains the name F Prime Prime, or FPP:

* By "integrating" an _F''_ model (i.e., running the FPP tools), you
get an _F'_ deployment that is partially implemented.
* By "integrating" the generated _F'_ deployment (i.e., completing the implementation),
you get a FSW application.
