This tool performs semantic checking of FPP models.

*Options:*

. `-u` _file_: Write unconnected ports to _file_.

*Input:*  A list _fl_ of files: either the single file _stdin_ or a list of 
files specified on the command line.

*Output:* 

. If the check succeeds, then no standard output; otherwise an error message.

. If the option `-u` is present, then write the names of all
unconnected port arrays to the specified file.
A port array is unconnected if it appears in a component instance used in
a topology, and there is no connection at any of its port numbers.

*Procedure*:

. Parse each of the files in _fl_, generating a list _tul_ of translation units.
When parsing, recursively resolve include specifiers.

. Perform https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Checking-Semantics[semantic checking] on _tul_.
