This tool parses FPP models, performs semantic checking on them, and writes out 
{cpp} files.

*Options:*

. `-d` _dir_: Set the output directory to _dir_.
If this option is not present, then the output directory is
the current directory.

. `-i` _files_: Import _files_.
These files are read in for their symbols, but their definitions do not cause 
any code to be generated.

. `-g` _prefix_: Specify a prefix for include guards that have no associated namespace.

. `-n` _file_: Write the names of the generated files to _file_.
This is useful for collecting build dependencies.

. `-p` _files_: Specify local prefixes to delete when generating include
guards and include paths.

. `-s` _string size_: Specify the default string size. 
If this option is present, the argument must be a decimal integer value between 1 and 1024.
If this option is not present, the default string size is 80.

. `-t`: Generate component implementation templates and no other code.

*Input:*  

. A list _fl_tr_ of files to translate: either the single file _stdin_ or a list of 
files specified on the command line.

. A list _fl_i_ of files to import, specified as arguments to the `-i` option.

*Output:* 

. A set of {cpp} files, written to the output directory.
By default these are the autocoded F Prime {cpp} files for constants,
types, ports, components, and topologies.
If the `-t` option is present, then these are the template files
for handwritten component implementations.

. If the `-n` option is present, then the names of the generated {cpp}
files.

*Procedure*:

. Parse each of the files in _fl_tr_, generating a list _tul_tr_ of translation units.
When parsing, recursively resolve include specifiers.

. Do the same for _fl_i_, generating a list _tul_i_.

. Perform https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Checking-Semantics[semantic checking] on 
the concatenation of _tul_fl_ and _tul_i_.

. Check that no two definitions in _tul_tr_ will generate a {cpp} file with the same name.
If so, halt with an error message.

. Generate the output for the definitions in _tul_tr_.
