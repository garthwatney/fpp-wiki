This algorithm traverses the source model and checks init specifiers.

== Input

. A list _tul_ of translation units.

. An 
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis-Data-Structure[analysis 
data structure] _a_
representing the results of analysis so far.

== Output

If the check passes, an updated analysis _a'_ with the init specifier map 
filled in; otherwise an error.

== Procedure

Visit each translation unit in _tul_ with input _a_,
yielding either _a'_ or an error.

=== AST Visitor Methods

Each method accepts an analysis data structure _a_ as input
and yields either an updated analysis data structure _a'_ or an error as 
output.

==== Translation Units

For each translation unit _tu_, visit each
definition appearing in _tu_.

==== Init Specifiers

For each init specifier _s_:

. Check that the types of the expressions in _s_ are correct.

. Update the init specifier map.
