This tool computes dependencies for FPP source files.

*Flags:*

. `-i` _file_: Write included dependencies to _file_.

. `-m` _file_: Write missing dependencies to _file_.

*Input:*  A list _fl_ of files: either the single file _stdin_ or a list of 
files specified on the command line.

*Output:* 

. A list of files (the dependencies), written one per line to standard 
output, as absolute paths with no other punctuation.
Included files in the dependency graph are not listed as dependencies.
For example, if a file `a.fpp` includes `b.fpp` and
`b.fpp` depends on `c.fpp`, then `a.fpp` depends on `c.fpp`
but not `b.fpp`.

. If option `-i` is present, then write included files in the dependency graph
to the specified file.

. If option `-m` is present, then write missing dependencies to the specified file.

*Procedure:*

. Create a fresh 
link:https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis-Data-Structure[analysis 
data structure] _a_.

. Add the specified input files other than _stdin_, if any, to the input files in _a_.

. Parse each of the files in _fl_, generating a list _tul_ of translation 
units.
When parsing, recursively resolve include specifiers and add the path of each
included file to the included file set in _a_.

. Let _a'_ be the result of 
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Computing-Dependencies[computing 
dependencies] with inputs _a_ and _tul_.

. Write out the dependency files in _a'_.

. If option `-i` is present, then write the included file set of _a'_ to the specified file.

. If option `-m` is present, then write the missing dependency file set of _a'_ to the specified file.
