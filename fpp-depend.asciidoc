This tool computes dependencies for FPP source files.

*Options:*

. `-d` _file_: Write direct dependencies to _file_.

. `-f` _file_: Write F Prime framework dependencies to _file_.

. `-g` _file_: Write the names of generated autocode files to _file_.

. `-i` _file_: Write included dependencies to _file_.

. `-m` _file_: Write missing dependencies to _file_.

. `-u`: Configure the `-g` and `-t` options to write unit test files.

. `-t` _file_: Write the names of generated implementation template files to _file_.

*Input:*  A list _fl_ of files: either the single file _stdin_ or a list of 
files specified on the command line.

*Output:* 

. A list of files (the dependencies), written one per line to standard 
output, as absolute paths with no other punctuation.
The dependencies are transitive.
For example, if `a.fpp` depends on `b.fpp` and `b.fpp` depends on
`c.fpp`, then `a.fpp` depends on `b.cpp` and on `c.fpp`.
Included files in the dependency graph are not counted as dependencies.
For example, if a file `a.fpp` includes `b.fpp` and
`b.fpp` depends on `c.fpp`, then `a.fpp` depends on `c.fpp`
but not `b.fpp`.

. If option `-d` is present, then write direct dependencies to the specified
file.
For example, if `a.fpp` depends on `b.fpp` and `b.fpp` depends on `c.fpp`,
then `a.fpp` directly depends on `b.fpp` but not on `c.fpp`.
Included files in the dependency graph are counted as direct
dependencies.

. If option `-f` is present, then write F Prime framework dependencies
to the specified file.

. If option `-g` is present, then write the names of generated autocode files
to the specified file.
The output here is the same as for
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/fpp-filenames[`fpp-filenames`],
or `fpp-filenames` `-u` if the `-u` option is also present.

. If option `-i` is present, then write included files in the dependency graph
to the specified file.

. If option `-m` is present, then write missing dependencies to the specified file.

. If option `-t` is present, then write the names of generated implementation template
files to the specified file.
The output here is the same as for
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/fpp-filenames[`fpp-filenames`] `-t`,
or `fpp-filenames` `-u` `-t`, if the `-u` option is also present.

*Procedure:*

. Create a fresh 
link:https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Analysis-Data-Structure[analysis 
data structure] _a_.

. Add the specified input files other than _stdin_, if any, to the input files in _a_.

. Parse each of the files in _fl_, generating a list _tul_ of translation 
units.
When parsing, recursively resolve include specifiers and add the path of each
included file to the included file set in _a_.

. Let _a'_ be the result of 
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/Computing-Dependencies[computing 
dependencies] with inputs _a_ and _tul_.

. Write out the dependency files in _a'_.

. If option `-d` is present, then write the direct dependency file set of
_a'_ to the specified file.

. If option `-f` is present, then write F Prime framework dependencies
to the specified file.
The currently recognized dependencies are as follows:

* `Fw_Comp` if _tul_ contains a passive component.
* `Fw_CompQueued` if _tul_ contains a queued or active component.
* `Os` if _tul_ contains a queued or active component or a guarded input port specifier.

. If option `-g` is present, then write the names of the generated autocode files
to the specified file.
Use the same procedure as for
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/fpp-filenames[`fpp-filenames`].

. If option `-i` is present, then write the included file set of _a'_ to the specified file.

. If option `-m` is present, then write the missing dependency file set of _a'_ to the specified file.

. If option `-t` is present, then write the names of the generated implementation
template files to the specified file.
Use the same procedure as for
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki/fpp-filenames[`fpp-filenames`].
