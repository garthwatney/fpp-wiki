This algorithm traverses the source model and checks port definitions.

== Input

. A list _tul_ of translation units.

. An 
https://github.com/nasa/fpp/wiki/Analysis-Data-Structure[analysis 
data structure] _a_
representing the results of analysis so far.

== Output

. The analysis _a_ if the check passes; otherwise an error.

== Procedure

. Visit each translation unit in _tul_ with input _a_,
yielding either _a_ or an error.

=== AST Visitor Methods

Each method accepts an analysis data structure _a_ as input
and yields either _a_ or an error as output.

==== Translation Units

For each translation unit _tu_, visit each
definition appearing in _tu_.

==== Port Definitions

. For each port definition _d_, check
that the parameter names in _d_ are unique.

. Return _a_ as the result.
